  "additional_limitations": "Readers should note that pregnant women enrolled in Medi-Cal are generally poor, usually unemployed, and lack private insurance. Their pregnancies may be marked not only by substance use, but by lack of self-care, poor nutrition, smoking, homelessness, and stress that may affect their pregnancy and their children. Because these factors have not been controlled for, readers should not attempt to compare health delivery systems to one another based solely on the statistics presented in this dataset. Many factors influence the likelihood of receiving a comorbidity diagnosis prior to or at the time of delivery, including insurance status, language barriers, and continuity of care. These factors may result in the underreporting of chronic conditions, especially in vulnerable populations. When comparing Medi-Cal populations, readers should be aware of subpopulation size. Although some Medi-Cal subpopulations may disclose a high percentage of adverse birth outcomes, they only constitute a small fraction of Medi-Cal’s total births. Readers should interpret the greater occurrence of negative health outcomes in these small groups in light of their population size. A necessary step in comparing outcomes among health systems is risk adjustment. Risk adjustment is a method used to remove or reduce the effects of confounding factors in studies in which cases are not randomly assigned to different treatments, or in this case, systems of care. Multivariable adjustment is outside the scope of this type of statistical report. This dataset is intended to provide descriptive statistics, not to draw conclusions about the health care delivery system.",

  "description": "California Birth Report totals by Birth Characteristics to inform the public, stakeholders, and researchers.\r\n\r\nThe DHCS Medi-Cal Birth Statistics tables present the descriptive statistics for California resident births that occurred in a hospital setting, including data on maternal characteristics, delivery methods, and select birth outcomes such as low birthweight and preterm delivery. Tables also include key comorbidities and health behaviors known to influence birth outcomes, such as hypertension, diabetes, substance use, pre-pregnancy weight, and smoking during pregnancy. \r\n\r\nDHCS additionally presents birth statistics for women participating in the Medi-Cal Fee-For-Service (FFS) and managed care delivery systems, as well as births financed by private insurance, births financed by other public funding sources, and births among uninsured mothers. Medi-Cal data reflect mothers that were deemed as Medi-Cal certified eligible.\r\n\r\n__Note:__ Data for maternal comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and substance use have been provisionally omitted among calendar years 2020-2022 for the time being.",
